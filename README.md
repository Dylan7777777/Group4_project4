# Group4_project4

Our project is titled "Heart Disease Indicator Project Outline"

We used a dataset containing the key indicators of a Heart Disease [1].
This dataset is originally built from CDC (Center of Disease Control) in the United States.
It contains data from 2022 of 400k+ adults and their health status.

The goal is to run 3 machine learning models (Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forests)
on columns grouped based on general attributes, ilness history and lifestyle in order to compare the result of the 3 and see if there's a correlation of having a heart disease.

There are 3 machine learning models on each Jupyter notebook, one notebook per group of attributes.
